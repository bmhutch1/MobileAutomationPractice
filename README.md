# MobileAutomationPractice
This project contains 3 practice questions.

This project is broken down into 3 questions represented by the 3 packages.

Each package contains a Main.java and Test.java class.

To execute, Run each Main.java as Java Application.

Alternatively, I have created tests for each individual part of the questions in the corresponding Test.java classes.
